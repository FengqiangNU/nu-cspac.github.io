# Northwestern University Computer Science PhD Advisory Council

### The Computer Science PhD Advisory Council (CSPAC) has a two-fold mission:
We seek to foster a community among Computer Science PhD students (CSPhDs), defined as all PhD students at Northwestern University who take one of the Computer Science qualifying exams outlined in the Graduate Student Manual in order to advance to candidacy in their degree. To this end, we:
* Provide funding for groups, activities, and events organized by CSPhDs
* Organize division-wide activities
* Serve as liaisons between CSPhDs, the department administrators, and faculty as needed

We seek to give a voice to CSPhDs in department decisions that directly impact student life. These include, but are not limited to:
* CSPhD student admissions
* Faculty hiring
* CSPhD student office spaces and locations
* Changes to CSPhD student graduation requirements
* Advocacy for diversity of background and viewpoint at all levels

The mission of the Computer Science PhD Advisory Council (CSPAC) is to foster a community within the student body of Computer Science 
PhD students at Northwestern University, and to give this community a voice within the Computer Science Division.

### Funding Student Iniatives
One of the primary functions of CSPAC is to help the department alot
financial resources to student iniatives, such as but not limited to
reading groups and professionalization workshops. Currently,
the Artificial Intelligence Journal Club (AIJC) is the only funded
student initiative. If you would like to solicit a proposal for funding
please email [**CSPAC@eecs.northwestern.edu**](mailto:CSPAC@eecs.northwestern.edu) with the following:
* Founding members or current leaders of initiative
* A summary of the initiative and how it will benefit the larger CS PhD community
* A budget which includes: 
	* Requested amount of funding
	* A detailed description of how the funding will help the overall student initiative

We will be reviewing proposals to be funded in the winter and spring quarters of 2018 starting in December
and will send notifications promptly upon the decision of the council.
