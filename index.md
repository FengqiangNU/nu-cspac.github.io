## The Computer Science PhD Advisory Council (CSPAC) has a two-fold mission:
We seek to foster a community among Computer Science PhD students (CSPhDs), 
defined as all PhD students at Northwestern University who take one of the 
Computer Science qualifying exams outlined in the Graduate Student Manual 
in order to advance to candidacy in their degree. To this end, we:
* Provide funding for groups, activities, and events organized by CSPhDs
* Organize division-wide activities
* Serve as liaisons between CSPhDs, the department administrators, and faculty as needed

We seek to give a voice to CSPhDs in department decisions that directly impact student life. These include, but are not limited to:
* CSPhD student admissions
* Faculty hiring
* CSPhD student office spaces and locations
* Changes to CSPhD student graduation requirements
* Advocacy for diversity of background and viewpoint at all levels

The mission of the Computer Science PhD Advisory Council (CSPAC) is to foster a community within the student body of Computer Science 
PhD students at Northwestern University, and to give this community a voice within the Computer Science Division.

## Current Members:
* Irina Rabkina (Cognitive Computing)
* Johes Bater (Databases)
* Jamie Gorson (CS+LS)
* Scott Allen Cambo (Human-Centered Machine Learning)
* German Espinosa (Distributed Robotics)
* Winston (Zihao) Wang (Computational Photography)
* Prem Seetharaman (Machine Learning from Audio)
* Abhratanu Dutta (CS Theory)

## Funding Student Iniatives
One of the primary functions of CSPAC is to help the department alot
financial resources to student iniatives, such as but not limited to
reading groups and professionalization workshops. Currently, we are 
working hard to put an application and funding process in place
for student initiatives. If you have any questions or suggestions in the
meantime, please email us at [**CSPAC@eecs.northwestern.edu**](mailto:CSPAC@eecs.northwestern.edu).
